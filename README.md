### Item Chat Display
Typing out item names every time you want to show someone in chat can get **tedious especially for long item names.** This plugin makes chat communication easier by introducing simple **item placeholders.**

When installed, player can type `{Item}` in chat, and it will automatically be replaced with the name of the item they're currently holding. You can also reference specific hotbar slots using `{Item:1}`, `{Item:2}`, ... `{Item:9}`, allowing players to quickly show items from any hotbar position without manually naming them.
